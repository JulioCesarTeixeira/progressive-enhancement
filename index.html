        <h2>The story</h2>
        <p class="first">Once upon a time there was a Chinese
            <mark class="thefarmer"> farmer</mark>
            whose horse ran away. That evening, all of
            <mark class="thevillagers">his neighbors</mark>
            came around
            to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is
                most unfortunate.</q> The
            farmer said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with
            it, and in the
            evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of
                events. You now have eight
                horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></p>
        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg.
            The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too
                <mark class="bad">bad</mark>
                ,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his
            son
            because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that
                great!</q> Again, he said,
            <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell
            whether anything that happens in it is
            <mark class="good"> good</mark>
            or
            <mark class="bad">bad</mark>
            — because
            you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
            consequences
            of
            <mark class="good">good</mark>
            fortune.
